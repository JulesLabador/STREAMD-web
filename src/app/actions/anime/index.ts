/**
 * Anime Server Actions
 *
 * NOTE: All read-only functions have been moved to @/lib/queries
 * This file is kept for backwards compatibility.
 *
 * For server components, import directly from @/lib/queries instead.
 * This file no longer exports anything as all functions are now in the queries module.
 *
 * @example
 * // Old import (deprecated):
 * import { getAnimeBySlug, getStudios } from "@/app/actions/anime";
 *
 * // New import (preferred):
 * import { getAnimeBySlug, getStudios } from "@/lib/queries";
